# Cyber Project Delay Dashboard

This project simulates and visualises milestone delays across synthetic cyber initiatives to demonstrate data wrangling, analysis, and visual storytelling skills using Python and Power BI.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `notebook/`: Python notebook to generate synthetic data and analyse average delay by risk category.
- `data/`: CSV file with synthetic cyber project delay data.
- `images/`: Chart visualising delay trends.
- `dashboard/`: Power BI `.pbix` file (if applicable).

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Power BI (or Power BI Service on Mac)
- GitHub

## 📊 Key Insights

- Average delays vary by risk category, with **Resource Constraints** and **3rd Party Delays** showing the highest average slippage.
- Power BI dashboard helps stakeholders visualise risks and prioritise mitigation strategies.
